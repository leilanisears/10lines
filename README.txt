Python3 
Made for 10 lines of day for 1 month challenge. :)

FILE LIST:
  * server.py - handles clients, TCP server using the socket lib in python, will be communicating with a database and handling queries as appropriate
  * setup.sh - downloads repo and configures some of the internals
  * client_handler.py - handles client queries --> be mindful of ISP changes for future instances of connections since IPs are hardcoded in

TO BE IMPLEMENTED:
  * database - SQL & SQLAlchemy

NOTES:
